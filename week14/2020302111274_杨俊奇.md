> P1. Suppose the information content of a packet is the bit pattern 1110 0110 1001  0101 and an even parity scheme is being used. What would the value of the field  containing the parity bits be for the case of a two-dimensional parity scheme?  Your answer should be such that a minimum-length checksum field is used.

11101

01100

10010

01010

01001

> P5. Consider the 5-bit generator, G = 10011, and suppose that D has the value  1010101010. What is the value of R?

R has 4 bits.
